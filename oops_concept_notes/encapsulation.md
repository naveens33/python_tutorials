Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that promotes the bundling of data and methods into a single unit called a class. It allows you to hide the internal details of an object and provide controlled access to its attributes and behaviors. In Python, encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers and property methods.

Here are the key aspects of encapsulation in Python:

## Access Modifiers:
Python provides naming conventions and access modifiers to indicate the intended level of accessibility for attributes and methods. The common access modifiers used are:

* Public: No specific prefix or naming convention. Public attributes and methods are openly accessible from anywhere.
* Protected: Prefix the attribute or method name with a single underscore (_). Protected attributes and methods can be accessed within the class and its subclasses.
* Private: Prefix the attribute or method name with a double underscore (__). Private attributes and methods are intended to be accessed only within the class itself.
Although these access modifiers are not strictly enforced, they serve as guidelines for developers to indicate the level of accessibility and encourage encapsulation.

## Property Methods:
Property methods, also known as getters and setters, provide a way to encapsulate attribute access and modification. They allow you to define custom methods for accessing and modifying the values of attributes, providing controlled access and ensuring data integrity.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        self._name = value

person = Person("Alice")
print(person.name)       # Output: Alice
person.name = "Bob"
print(person.name)       # Output: Bob
```
In this example, the Person class has a private attribute _name. The name property method is defined using the @property decorator, which allows us to access the value of _name like a normal attribute. The name property also has a setter method defined using the @name.setter decorator, which enables us to modify the value of _name while performing any necessary validations or operations.

Using property methods, we can encapsulate the access and modification of attributes and control how they are accessed and modified from outside the class.

Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, information hiding, and modularity in object-oriented programming. It allows you to separate the interface of an object from its implementation, providing a clean and controlled way to interact with objects and ensuring the integrity and security of data.
