List comprehension is a concise and powerful way to create lists in Python. It provides a compact syntax for creating a new list by iterating over an existing iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and applying transformations or filtering conditions to each element. List comprehension is known for its readability and brevity. Here's the general syntax:

```
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

Let's explore the different components of list comprehension:

* expression: This is the expression or transformation applied to each item in the iterable to create elements in the new list.

* item: This represents each item in the iterable that is being iterated over.

* iterable: This is the existing iterable (e.g., list, tuple, string) from which the elements are taken.

* condition (optional): This is an optional condition or filter applied to each item. Only items that satisfy the condition are included in the new list.

Now, let's see some examples of list comprehension to better understand its usage:

## Creating a list of squares:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
## Filtering even numbers:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
evens = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)  # Output: [2, 4]
```
## Creating a list of uppercase letters from a string:

```
text = "Hello, World!"
uppercase_letters = [letter for letter in text if letter.isupper()]
print(uppercase_letters)  # Output: ['H', 'W']
```
## Generating a list of tuples:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
tuples = [(x, x ** 2) for x in numbers]
print(tuples)  # Output: [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)]
```
List comprehension is a powerful construct in Python that allows you to create new lists with concise and readable code. It is widely used to perform transformations, filtering, and other operations on iterables, providing an elegant way to work with lists in Python.

## Q&A:
* Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7
* Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that have a 3 in them
* Count the number of spaces in a string
* Create a list of all the consonants in the string “Yellow Yaks like yelling and yawning and yesturday they yodled while eating yuky yams”
* Get the index and the value as a tuple for items in the list “hi”, 4, 8.99, ‘apple’, (‘t,b’,’n’). Result would look like (index, value), (index, value)
* Find the common numbers in two lists (without using a tuple or set) list_a = 1, 2, 3, 4, list_b = 2, 3, 4, 5
* Get only the numbers in a sentence like ‘In 1984 there were 13 instances of a protest with over 1000 people attending’
* Given numbers = range(20), produce a list containing the word ‘even’ if a number in the numbers is even, and the word ‘odd’ if the number is odd. Result would look like ‘odd’,’odd’, ‘even’
* Produce a list of tuples consisting of only the matching numbers in these lists list_a = 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, list_b = 2, 7, 1, 12. Result would look like (4,4), (12,12)
* Find all of the words in a string that are less than 4 letters
* Use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9)
