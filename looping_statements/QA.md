# Interview Questions
3. What is break, continue and pass statement?
    
    |Statement|Definition|
    |---|-----|
    |Break|Allows loop termination when some condition is met and the control is transferred to the next statement.|
    |Continue|Allows skipping some part of a loop when some specific condition is met and the control is transferred to the beginning of the loop|
    |Pass|Used when you need some block of code syntactically, but you want to skip its execution. This is basically a null operation. Nothing happens when this is executed.|

4. xrange() vs range()
In Python 2 we have the following two functions to produce a list of numbers within a given range.

* range()
* xrange()
in Python 3, xrange() is deprecated, i.e. xrange() is removed from python 3.x.

5. ternary operator
The Ternary operator is the operator that is used to show the conditional statements

x = 5 if 5 < 3 else 6

## Programs

1. Program to calculate the sum of first n natural number.
2. Program to find the factorial value of n number. 
3. Program to find a number is a Armstrong number or not.
4. Program to print out all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 1000.
5. Program to print Fibonacci series of n terms.
6. Program to find all Perfect numbers between 1 to n.
   
      perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. 
7. Program to print all Prime numbers between 1 to n.
8. Program to find sum of all prime numbers between 1 to n.
