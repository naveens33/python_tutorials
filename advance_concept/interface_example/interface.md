### What is Interface
* An interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes.
* Like classes, interfaces define methods. Unlike classes, these methods are abstract.
* An abstract method is one that the interface simply defines. It doesn’t implement the methods.
* Implementation is done by classes, which then implement the interface and give concrete meaning to the interface’s abstract methods.

### Type of interface in Python
* Informal
* Formal

### Informal Interface
An informal Python interface is a class that defines methods that can be overridden, but there’s no strict enforcement.
