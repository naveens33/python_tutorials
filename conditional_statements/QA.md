# Interview Questions

1. ternary operator
The Ternary operator is the operator that is used to show the conditional statements

[on true] if [expression] else [on false]

x = 5 if 5 < 3 else 6

2. break and continue statements
Both break and continue are statements that control flow in Python loops. break stops the current loop from executing
further and transfers the control to the next block. continue jumps to the next iteration of the loop without exhausting it.
