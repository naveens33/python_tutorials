The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system. It offers various functions for tasks such as file and directory management, process management, environment variables, and more. Here are some commonly used functions and features of the os module:

### Working with Files and Directories:

* os.getcwd(): Returns the current working directory.
* os.chdir(path): Changes the current working directory to the specified path.
* os.listdir(path): Returns a list of all files and directories in the specified path.
* os.mkdir(path): Creates a new directory at the specified path.
* os.makedirs(path): Creates intermediate directories if they don't exist in the specified path.
* os.remove(path): Removes (deletes) the file at the specified path.
* os.rmdir(path): Removes (deletes) the empty directory at the specified path.
* os.removedirs(path): Removes (deletes) directories recursively, starting from the specified path.
* os.rename(src, dst): Renames a file or directory from src to dst.
### Working with Paths:

* os.path.join(path1, path2, ...): Joins multiple path components intelligently.
* os.path.exists(path): Checks if a path exists.
* os.path.isfile(path): Checks if the path refers to a file.
* os.path.isdir(path): Checks if the path refers to a directory.
* os.path.abspath(path): Returns the absolute path of a file or directory.
### Environment Variables:

* os.environ: A dictionary-like object containing the current environment variables.
* os.getenv(var_name): Returns the value of the specified environment variable.
os.putenv(var_name, value): Sets the value of the specified environment variable.
### Running System Commands:

* os.system(command): Executes the command in a subshell.
* os.popen(command): Opens a pipe to or from the command, allowing reading or writing.
* os.spawnl(mode, path, ...): Spawns a new process using the specified mode and path.
