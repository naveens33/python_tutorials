The datetime module in Python is a built-in module that provides classes for manipulating dates and times. It allows you to create, manipulate, format, and perform calculations with dates and times.

Here's a brief overview of some commonly used classes and functions in the datetime module:

* datetime class: This class represents a combination of a date and a time. You can create a datetime object using the datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second) constructor.

* date class: This class represents a date (year, month, day) without the time component. You can create a date object using the date(year, month, day) constructor.

* time class: This class represents a time (hour, minute, second) without the date component. You can create a time object using the time(hour, minute, second) constructor.

* timedelta class: This class represents a duration or difference between two datetime objects. It allows you to perform arithmetic operations on dates and times. You can create a timedelta object using the timedelta(days, seconds, microseconds, milliseconds, minutes, hours, weeks) constructor.

* datetime.now(): This function returns the current local date and time as a datetime object.

* datetime.strftime(format): This method formats a datetime object as a string based on the specified format string. It returns a string representing the datetime object according to the format.

Example:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Format the current date and time as a string
formatted_datetime = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print(formatted_datetime)  # Output: 2023-07-05 15:30:00

# Format the current date as a string
formatted_date = now.strftime("%d %B, %Y")
print(formatted_date)  # Output: 05 July, 2023

# Format the current time as a string
formatted_time = now.strftime("%I:%M %p")
print(formatted_time)  # Output: 03:30 PM

# Format the current year as a string
formatted_year = now.strftime("%Y")
print(formatted_year)  # Output: 2023

# Format the current month as a string
formatted_month = now.strftime("%B")
print(formatted_month)  # Output: July

# Format the current day of the week as a string
formatted_day_of_week = now.strftime("%A")
print(formatted_day_of_week)  # Output: Wednesday
```

* datetime.strptime(date_string, format): This method parses a string representing a date and time and returns a datetime object. The format string specifies the expected format of the input string.

* datetime.timedelta: This function calculates the difference between two datetime objects and returns a timedelta object.

These are just a few of the commonly used functions and classes provided by the datetime module. The module offers more functionality for working with dates, times, and intervals.
