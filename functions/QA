# Interview Questions
1. What is a function
    
    A function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called. To define a Python function, the def keyword is used.
2. What is callable

   * Functions and methods are called callable
   * In fact, any object which implements the special method __call__() is termed callable.

3. How would you define a block in Python

    Python does not support curly braces. This means we must end such statements with colons and then write the code with indent.

    ```
    def getlength(num):
    len=0
    while(num!=0):
        len+=1
        num=num//10
    return len  
    ```
