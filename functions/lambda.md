An anonymous function or lambda function) is a way to create small, one-line functions without explicitly defining a function using the def keyword. Lambda expressions are often used when you need a simple function for a short period of time, such as for filtering, mapping, or sorting data. Here's the syntax for a lambda expression:
```
lambda arguments: expression
```
The arguments section specifies the input arguments for the lambda function, and the expression section defines the operation or calculation to be performed. The result of the expression is automatically returned by the lambda function.

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the usage of lambda expressions:

Example 1: Adding two numbers using a lambda expression:
```
add = lambda x, y: x + y
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

Example 2: Squaring a number using a lambda expression:

```
square = lambda x: x ** 2
result = square(4)
print(result)  # Output: 16
```
Example 3: Filtering a list using a lambda expression:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
Example 4: Mapping a list using a lambda expression:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Lambda expressions are particularly useful in scenarios where you need a simple function on the fly, without the need for defining a full-fledged named function. They provide a concise and compact way of expressing functionality. However, keep in mind that lambda expressions
