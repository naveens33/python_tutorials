# Variable 

A variable is something which can change. A variable is a way of referring to a memory location used by a computer program. 
In many programming languages a variable is a symbolic name for this physical location. This memory location contains values, like numbers, text or more complicated types. 
You can use this variable to tell the computer to save some data in this location or to retrieve some data from this location.

While you see in other languages like C, C++ and Java. Variable names have to be declared before assign a value. For example,

int a;

a=5;

int b;

b=7;

But in python there is no need for an explicit declaration to reserve memory. 
The assignment is done using the equal to (=). For example,

a=5

b=6
